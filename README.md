# Frostbyte's Slabs & Stairs (Fabric)

**Overview:**

This mod adds many partial-block variants of vanilla blocks, including concrete, terracotta, the decorative stone types, and more. The reasoning behind which blocks received which variants was decided somewhat arbitrarily, but follows this basic form:

- Walls were given to all stone-type blocks
- Slabs and Stairs were given to all metal-, wood-, and stone-type blocks
- Fences and Fence Gates were given to all wood-type blocks and nether bricks
- Buttons and Pressure Plates were given to all metal, wood- and base form stone-types (excludes, cracked, chiseled, etc.)

**Notes:**

- I used the vanilla recipe patterns when creating the recipes for the new blocks. As a consequence, some vanilla crafting recipes may have been overwritten. I reccomend using a mod or datapack that allows you to choose between multiple outputs from the same recipe, such as this one: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/polymorph-fabric. (I am working on my own port of this mod for the current version, but until then, you have been warned)
- While I consider this mod "complete", there are some changes I will be making in the future, such as making the copper block variants oxidize. Check this page somewhat regularly in case of such updates.

**FAQs:**

- *Will this be updated to 1.x.x?* - Yes! I plan on updating this mod for as long as I can. Expect to wait a few weeks after major Minecraft updates for an updated version of this mod.
- *Will you make a Forge version?* - No. I don't make Forge mods, but feel free to make your own (unofficial) port as long as you credit me for any code borrowed from this mod.
- *Can I use this in my mod pack?* - Yes! I made this mod for people to use!
